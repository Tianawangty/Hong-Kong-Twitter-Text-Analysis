# Hong-Kong-Twitter-Text-Analysis
Here is a text analysis project analyzing tweets scraped during 2019 Hong Kong Protest.
#### The project has been written in a research paper and submitted to Text as Data, a graduate-level course in Government Analytics program at the Johns Hopkins University.
## 1. Background Introduction
Starting from April 2019, a series of protests arguing about the extradition bill happened in Hong Kong and became sizable and massive since June 2019. On March 29, 2019, Hong Kong published a revised extradition laws which allow the Hong Kong Chief Executive to transfer fugitives case-by-case by to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty, including the mainland China so that massive Hong Kong protestors concerned that the bill could be abused by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Many protestors think the revised extradition law is a sign which indicates that Hong Kong loses its autonomy power based on “One country, two systems” policy. 
## 2. Twitter as A Source for Analysis
The protest occurred on the street in New Territories, the Kowloon Peninsula, Hong Kong Island, and online by using Twitter, which is the online battleground for all the people who have paid attention to Hong Kong protests. Back in 2014, Facebook, Twitter was the top 2 social media sources for participants, and social media is one of the most significant factors affecting citizens’ participation in the Umbrella Movement (Lee & Chan, 2016). Besides, the Hong Kong protest is a leaderless movement, so the series of protests were organized mainly by the use of social media. Therefore, twitter plays a crucial role in the organization and discussion of Hong Kong protests.

## 3. Research Introduction 
Given the background above, the purpose of this research is to restore the 2019 Hong Kong protests by analyzing data collected from Twitter. Because the protest has lasted for five months, this paper addresses two significant turning points that happened during the period of Anti-extradition bill to illustrate the sentiment changes of the protestors over time. This paper is an exploratory analysis of the series of protests by using STM topic modeling algorithms. The paper analyzes how the protesters acted and present a summary of their main demands and opinions. The paper could identify the multiple subjects of each period and the tactics used by the tweet users to better understand the situation.

## 4. GitHub Repository Illustration 
The code section illustrates the process of data preprocessing and text analysis. The analysis includes Documents-Features-Matrix (DFM) using Quanteda, sentiments analysis using VADER sentiment analysis package in Python, co-currence network maps on User names as well as hashtags, and topic modeling using STM.

## 5. Disclaimer
The purpose of this Github repository is to give an example showing a general workflow of text analysis and how STM model could be used in text analysis. The data given in this Github repository are scraped from Twitter API and is only the data from late June 2019 for illustration purpose. The data here is not the data source for the original research paper. All the materials here shall not be used in any other purpose.
